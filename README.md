# Employee Salary System
One of my personal projects made with VB 6.0, with the guidance of my mentor and teacher.

This is a small but real life HRMS application with following features:
1. Employee Data Management
2. Employee Salary Data Management
3. Payslip Generation
4. RBAC Working Model

This application uses offline Access database(.mdb)

If you are a HR or owner of a small company who needs to:
1. Actively manage Employee data
2. Actively manage Payroll of your employees
3. Generate Payslip on-demand
4. Do all the above in a secure manner by having Administrator User(s) and Normal User(s)

Then you can ask me to package this application and send it to you !!
